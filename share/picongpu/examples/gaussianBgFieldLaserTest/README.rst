Laser-wakefield accelerator setup for a laser pulse based on PIConGPUs "background field" mechanism. The laser pulse model includes first-order corrections for ultrashort, fs-scale durations and strong focusing according to [Hua2004]. This alternative laser can replace the usual laser and has the advantage that one insert the laser into the simulation from any direction within the y-z-plane. Also one can use an arbitrary number of different laser pulses.

This is a demonstration setup for quick testing of this feature with bad resolution and unphysically high plasma gradients. In addition to the regular laser, the setup includes a background-field laser, which does not propagate along the usual y-axis, but crosses the simulation volume along the transverse z-axis, such as a probe beam. The configured incident angle (here: 90Â°) is measured agains the y-axis. For demonstration purposes, the probe beam features the same intensity as the initial drive laser.
